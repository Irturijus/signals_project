1. Choose a song from the folder "songs" and drag it to the "process_song" folder. Ensure there is only one audio file in "process_song" with OGG format.
(The song used in the video was blacksheepedit.ogg)

2. Run the "run_me.py" python file. When the program completes, a browser window should open with the online tool you need to view the result.
If it does not open, then you have to open this online tool manually (Link: https://allpoland.github.io/ArcViewer/).

3. Click the folder icon to the left of the search box and then choose the beatmap.zip file that was created by the code in this directory.

4. Make sure that you can hear sound played by your computer.

5. When the level loads, on the bottom left, you should see a white triangle. Click it to start viewing the generated Beat Saber level.

6. Beat Saber levels often come with several difficulty options. On the bottom right of the ArcViewer window, you can choose the difficulty you want to view.

Feel free to try this project out with different songs! (only .ogg format is supported)
